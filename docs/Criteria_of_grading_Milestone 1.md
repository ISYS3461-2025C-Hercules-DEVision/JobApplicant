# Criteria of grading:

## Data Model Requirements

(1) ER Model of the implemented database is suitable for storing the data requirements of Level Simplex, Medium, and Ultimo;  
(2) ER Models of the implemented and proposed databases are presented in the form of a Class Diagram and follow UML notations or Crow’s Foot Notation for relationships.  
(3) The Justification of Data Model thoroughly addresses the Scalability, Performance, and Resilience Factors.

### To achieve 4 to >3.2 pts: Excellent

(1) The ER model comprehensively and optimally addresses all data requirements of Levels Simplex, Medium, and Ultimo with up to two minor flaws. If a SQL Database is used, the model is highly normalized, efficiently handles relationships, and minimizes redundancy.  
(2) All Entities, attributes, relationships are identified with correct cardinality and participation attributes according to a consistent syntax. The diagram is professionally presented with highly readable content.  
(3) The Justification of Data Model reasonably and meticulously explains strategies to enhance the Scalability, Performance, and Resilience Factors.

## Architecture Design

The UML Component / C4 Model Architecture Diagrams:

(1) Address the architecture requirements of Levels Simplex, Medium, and Ultimo.  
(2) Address the software requirements of Levels Simplex, Medium, and Ultimo.  
(3) Provide justification on the tradeoffs regarding Maintainability, Extensibility, Resilience, Scalability, Security, and Performance of the system architecture.

### To achieve 8 to >6.4 pts: Excellent

1) The UML Component / C4 Model Architecture Diagrams fully meet all specified functional requirements, including edge cases. The designs are scalable, maintainable, consistent, and resilient, demonstrating advanced problem-solving skills.  
2) The UML Component / C4 Model Architecture Diagrams address the architecture requirements of all levels to an outstanding degree. The design fosters scalability, extensibility, maintainability, resistance to failure, security, and minimizes latency or bottleneck.  
3) Thorough justifications with solid arguments on the strengths and limitations of the design with regards to the six factors.

## Aesthetic and Professionalism of the Architecture Design Diagrams

### To achieve 2 to >1.8 pts: Excellent

1) **Clarity and Conciseness:** The diagram is clear, well-organized, and easy to understand. There is no unnecessary clutter or complexity.  
2) **Visual Appeal:** The diagram is visually appealing and uses consistent colors, fonts, and styles.  
3) **Professionalism:** The diagram adheres to industry standards and best practices for architectural diagrams as shown in examples of the C4 Model or the corresponding UML documentation.  
4) **Completeness:** The diagram includes all relevant components, relationships, annotations, and legends for different color-coded elements.

## Teamwork  
Collaborations with the Team and Squad in Software Development Activities

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
> The proportion of individual contribution AFFECTS THEIR GRADES of Data Model and Architecture Design sections.  
If a student does not contribute to the Data Model, they will receive **0 point** for the Data Model section.

### To achieve 4 to >3.2 pts: Excellent

1) Team has completed the Contribution Document.  
2) Team member has significant activity and regular completion of tasks over the entire course of the assessment.  
3) Team members excellently leverage the features of GitHub and a Project Management Tool.

## Presentation

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:**  
> Members who CANNOT answer the technical questions from the Lecturer will be considered as not participating in the development of the related technical feature. Therefore, their individual grades of Presentation, Architecture Design, Data Model, and/or Teamwork WILL BE DEDUCTED at the lecturer’s discretion.

### To achieve 2 to >1.6 pts: Excellent

1) **Clarity and Conciseness:** The team concisely articulates how the data model and system architecture design provide the features requested in the presentation requirements.  
2) Team members reasonably explain the system architecture, data model, and design decision rationales, including the advantages and drawbacks of the system and subsystem.  
3) **Presentation Style:**  
   a) The presentation draws attention from the audience to follow the motivation and features of the application.  
   b) Pace of speech is appropriate, not too fast or too slow.  
   c) Engaging, non-monotonous speech.  
   d) Appropriate use of language; no slang, informal, sexist, racist words, or hate speech.  
   e) The SQUAD presentation length is within 20 minutes.
